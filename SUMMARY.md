**Teeth Segmentation on Dental X-ray Images** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 598 images with 15021 labeled objects belonging to 32 different classes including *23*, *25*, *26*, and other: *24*, *27*, *22*, *28*, *21*, *11*, *8*, *9*, *6*, *10*, *7*, *15*, *20*, *29*, *2*, *12*, *3*, *5*, *14*, *4*, *31*, *13*, *18*, *19*, *30*, *1*, *17*, *16*, and *32*.

Images in the Teeth Segmentation on Dental X-ray Images dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 3 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023 by the Humans In The Loop, Bulgaria.
