**Teeth Segmentation on dental X-ray images** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 598 images with 15021 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (_tooth_).

Images in the Teeth Segmentation on dental X-ray images dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 3 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: _ds_ (598 images). The dataset was released in 2023.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
