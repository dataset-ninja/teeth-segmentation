**Teeth Segmentation on Dental X-ray Images** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 598 images with 15021 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tooth*).

Images in the Teeth Segmentation on Dental X-ray Images dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 3 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Humans In The Loop, Bulgaria](https://humansintheloop.org/).
